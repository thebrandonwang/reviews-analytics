These are very comfortable but I took one star away because they took a little time to break in, unlike my Clarks Wave sandals which were immediately comfortable.  I was looking for a dressier alternative to the Waves which feel wonderful but look very utilitarian. The Leisa looks prettier but you are giving up some comfort.  The straps are a bit thin and stiff so they dug in and chafed a little until I figured out how to adjust them (for me they work best when I keep the front strap snug but the back strap as loose as possible).  Now that they are broken in I look forward to wearing them on my upcoming vacation - they'll be great for walking around and exploring while also looking cute with my summer dresses.
I love these boots. I have a wide foot and needed comfortable boots that I can wear all day without getting tired and still look classy.These boots were perfect and oh so comfortable. Everyone made a comment about how great they look.
well the price of this watch is 23 dollars, but it is better to add extra and buy better product
Runs very big.  I had to send them back.  I think I would have to order them at least one whole size or more smaller.
I really love this ring. It fits well, feels good, and looks great. I've had several compliments on it. It's a really nice ring (and it doesn't turn my finger green - LOL).
I ordered the Coach Antique and the Brown.  I got a lot of compliments regarding the color of these boots.  The color is beautiful.  The gold buckles set them off.  Unfortunately, after wearing the Coach Antique boots twice, the heel started to wobble and I was afraid that I would fall and break an ankle.  I am 5'7" and 154 pounds.  The heels are not that high nor narrow.  You have good support.  When I looked at my Brown boots, one of the heel's tip was missing.  These boots are made of very poor material.  If you have already ordered them, please send them back before it's too late to get a refund or give them to your worst enemy.
Ordered this dress despite the bad reviews and I'm glad I did. Nice light weight cotton blend. Sort of reminds me of a those sort of sheer t-shirts although not as sheer. Very simple design that's perfect for the very petit. No problems with stitching or seams (I sew so I'd know a problem if I saw it). It even got to me 16 days before its estimated arrival.
I really like these earrings. They are not to big, but big enough especially if you don't have really long hair. The diamonds are small, but what do you want for $24.99. They sort of look like silver, but then when you look close you can see the diamonds. I am happy with them, especially the size, they are about the size of a quarter, maybe a little bigger, but not much bigger .The size is what mattered to me, I didn't want really big hoops or really small ones, I think they are just a perfect size hoop.
These shoes do run small.  I ordered a size 1 for my daughter who wears a size 13.  The length is fine but the width is wide!  I ordered a medium width and I would say they are more like a wide.  They are even too wide after pulling the ties tight.
The Fit and quality are both great, It is a very sensual when worn. It may be become  my favorite thong
Bought 2 of these to wear with my platinum diamond engagement ring..Just after about a month or so, stones began falling out.  right now, there's only about half of the stones still intact.  No problems with the stainless steel aspect though.  The metal looks good next to the platinum, just wish it still had all the stones.  Very disappointed...
Love this briefcase.  I had a three gusset expandable brief I got from Wilson's Leather a few years ago, but the handle broke a while back, and since I didn't have time to shop for a new bag, for several months I was using both a computer backpack, and a freebie messenger bag I got at a trade show.  Tired of looking like a schlub, an having people asking me if I worked for [company name on the free bag], I decided I needed something a bit more professional looking.  Looked at a lot of different bags, some twice as expensive as this, and this seemed to have the right blend of looks, storage options and versatility.  Once I got it, I realized I wasn't wrong - it is very slick-looking, but not so fancy that I can't wear it in casual dress.  Zippers all work very smoothly, and the hardware is finished in a tasteful brushed silver.As for storage - the front pocket fits knickknacks like earbuds, several pens, cards, etc, with a padded cellphone pocket that fits an iPhone or a large-ish Android (Samsung Galaxy S II) perfectly.  A small zippered pocket inside the front pocket - if it were a little bigger to fit a passport, that would be awesome, but it's not a huge deal, as it's the perfect size for cleaning cloths for my cellphones and tablets.  The middle pocket has two padded pockets side by side, each taking up about half the width.  These are the perfect size for notebooks, or 7" tablets like my Nexus 7.  The remaining space is separated into two compartments by a stiff divider - I throw my iPad into one compartment, and things like a charger, headset, travel accessories, etc. into the other.  Finally, the laptop compartment fits my 14.1" Lenovo well, with a bit of extra room on the sides.  Don't expect to throw a charger or any bulky accessories in the lapotop compartment - while most other briefcases I've had have a bit of room for stuff like that in the laptop pocket, in this bag, those should go in the middle pocket.  You can put notebooks in here, but more than a Moleskine or a slim training manual would be a tight fit with anything but a slim ultrabook or Macbook Air.Overall, this seems a very good deal as long as you don't pack a lot of accessories - if you're a hardcore road warrior, and tend to pack bigger accessories like a dock, travel projector, or extra charger with you, it will be a tight fit, and you'll want a wheeled brief.  But for the average business traveler, this is an excellent choice, and very well laid out.  I'll try to put some pictures up when I can.
I really like the Dansko shoes. These are so pretty.  There was not even any brake in time. Took them out to the box and just wear them.
I Love these shoes!!! I know have six pairs in many colors.  Everyone who sees these shoes always ask what they are and where I can get them.  Amazon.com has a great sellection and a fantastic price.
this was a gift for my wife and she loves it. the sizes run realy small i would suggest getting a size bigger. well made shipped fast very happy.
I purchased this on-line shortly before a trip to the Caribbean. The size runs almost a little big, and I found them to be highly supportive. I have fallen arches and w/o a great arch support my toes cramp, and this shoe was super supportive--no cramping after a day of wear and lots of walking! The micro-fiber style to the trim makes for great comfort from the start. there was no &#34;breaking-in&#34; of this shoe for me. A good shoe at a good price!
This pretty little ring is adorable! I was looking for a replacement wedding ring. I wanted something simple and delicate looking. This definitely fit the bill! It's beautiful and fit perfectly. The price at 2.99 was amazing and now I see that it's only 1.99! Excellent product and I would definitely recommend it!
I love it whatever  event rather its dressed or casual this dress does it and you can feel comfortable & sexy the whole time.
This is a beautiful little charm supporting survivors and research of cervical/ovarian cancers.The seller delivers quickly, much more quickly than I expected.I'm happy with this purchase and will use this vendor for more charms in the future.
The setting is wonderful.  But the stone is just okay- the ring has to angled just right toward the light to see the green labradorite.  Otherwise you see just a gray stone most of the time.
These shoes are one of my all time favorite shoes...feminine yet business like...comfortable shoe and great heel height...dress it up dress it down...takes you to work and out for dinner...I'm looking for another pair or two to keep in my closet before I can't find them any more!!!  True to size including the heel.  LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM!!!!
This product worked great and did for my wife and I what I was hoping. The package contained a total of three batteries and a single battery lasted over 30 minutes. Very easy to secure in place and start up. Great vibrating action. Perfectly sized. Thank you vibrating tongue manufacturers and distributors :) !!! -KS. Youngstown Ohio.
I love combat boots and I love studs but all the boots that fit in that category look so cheap and everyone has them. Then I came across these and I fell in love. They fit as expected and go with any outfit. Super Satisfied.
I bought these, because I wanted some simple studs for my wedding day. They arrived before estimated time and they looked amazing, they really do sparkle a lot.
I used my etip gloves for two weeks.  The silver "swipe" tips on both gloves are totally frayed.  This glove is an excellent idea.  Unfortunately it's a total execution failure.  Not what I would have excpected from a North Face product. I used the gloves as inner liners during a two week snowboard trip.  At this point they are so frayed that they don't work anymore and I have to throw the gloves in the garbage.  Only buy these gloves if you're not going to do any sort of outdoor activities requiring touching anything other than your iphone!
I needed orthotic shoes ... but didn't like the look of most.  These are great shoes that work with orthotics ... and don't look a bit like orthotic shoes!!  Very comfortable and neat looking.
in all fairness.....i think that this descente hat wiil be just fine for my use - steetware - that is if it ever arrives .amazon needs to op-out of its prime program , because prime items never arrive within three days or less . why waste your money on this program - when amazon is unable to control this problem .
The product is too large. I buy a women product and when choose the size i select 9 1/2 in women size, but i recive the product was 9 1/2 in men's size so is enormous.
All characters at once!Only trouble is that I cannot attach these to anything else, like backpacks or other things.
These come in nice fashionable colors - purchased purple and pink (not sure what true description color is).  Like that it has slight padding, nice breathable material, comfortable fit.  Wear them for the gym -cardio and warm yoga where I sweat a lot and these do not stick and straps stay still.
excellent price and the transit time as well.the product was received just like is shown on the website.it was received on perfect conditions.I recommend to buy this.
I often carry a MacBook Air 11" back and forth to work, so I was looking for new bag that would be as small, light, comfortable and fit only the things I needed to fit (so I wouldn't be tempted to weigh myself down). After an exhaustive comparison with TimBuk2 and other bags at a few outdoor stores, I settled on this one six weeks ago and I have been thoroughly happy with it.A few pro tips:1) The bag does not have a cross-strap for stability when biking, so I attached a light-weight carabiner and purchased a $7.50 TimBuk2 cross-strap which works perfectly2) I suspect this bag will not work out well in the rain since there's no zipper or other closure across the main compartment.3) The stiching on one of the straps started to fray after one month. I contacted MountainSmith customer support, sent a photo of the problem, and they mailed me a replacement strap right away.  Good service.Lastly, I love the bright yellow lining. It makes it so easy to find things.P.
I've been purchasing New Balance sneakers for more than decade.  I chose New Balance because they have a better selection than others in the EEEE width.  I usually get them at a local sporting store.  They were out, so I tried on Amazon.  Amazon had better prices and a better selection.  I tried the MX608 this time, which is one I have not seen at my local store.  It fits and performs like other New Balances I have owned, with one major exception -- the bottom, back of the heel is attached poorly.  The bottom 1/4 of the heel has become unattached on my left shoe.  The bottom 1/8 of the heel has become unattached on the other.  I expect the left is worse than the right because it my clutch pedal foot.  The heel started to come ofter after only ~1 month and has continually grown worse during the 4 months since then.  This has never happened with any other New Balance shoe I have owned. I'd write it off as a rare anomaly if it was only on one shoe, but since it happened on both, I believe it is a design problem and will likely happen to others.
I am very happy with this shoe.  It fits well and looks good on my foot.  it can be worn with both casual and dressy clothing.  I have always been satisfied with Clarks Shoes.  This is the first time I have ordered shoes through the internet and was happy with the experience.
Some say I lacked conviction... others doubted the color of my blood, but when I go out to the Clubs and or other American drinking establishments let it be known henceforth... this gentleman breathes red white and blue drinks red white and blue and good god damn knows he loves America.
Very nice T-Shirts love the fact that they are heavy duty. Like Fruit of the Loom products, never had a problem with them.Karen
I always have problems finding flats that do not rub my heel. These are perfect. I also have them in gold. They are extremely comfortable and shipped to me so quickly.  Definitely a YES!
This is my 3rd pair of El Naturalista, so I love their shoes.  But this one is uncomfortable due to 1) the higher heels/arch that I am not used to (my problem?) and 2) the stiffer front so my toes HURT after just a couple of hours.
These are the best running shoe I've ever owned.  I had the previous versions which were good, but these are amazing.  I have a narrow foot so have some difficulty with fit but these fit perfect.  I even did the ultimate no no for runners and wore this brand new pair of shoes for my 5k this morning and ran a PR! Can't say enough good things about these shoes.  Will definitely be picking up another pair.Mizuno Women's Wave Inspire 9 Running Shoe
I just received these lovely boots today 12/12/11 and just ordered them a few days ago. I tried them on must say true to the size. I ordered size 8.5 and could have ordered them in a size 8. You can tell they are exspensive boots for a lower prize. Very comfortable and just love the way they fit. I will be ordering more from this company. Thank you for the affortable price boots like these..I just love these boots.Thank you so much.
This watch is great for the money, but is missing some features that I think make it suitable.  there's no light on it, which I knew, but thought it wouldn't matter much.  Now owning it, i realize that it matters.  I find that due to the ease in which it enters the mode in which the time changes, i often change the time accidentally.
Soft breathable jersey fabric, and even the mesh is soft and stretchy. I have a wide ribcage (33.5&#34;) but moderate bust and this fits me beautifully. I'm not able to wrap the ties around my ribcage and tie in the back, but I just tie it in the front and it's still sexy. No sagging and not too tight. Arrived just 5 days after ordering! Thank you I love it!
Watch is lovely with a large and easy to read face which is more and more important to me now that my 60's are here.  Quality is clearly visible.  Did have to take it to a jeweler to have many links taken out.  My wrist is not small, but the watch band was HUGE.  no complaints though; better too big than too small!
I wanted the beanies because I prefer them over any other kind of headwear. Plus I like the way they fit tight. These were really loose and the material feels very weak. I was really disappointed.
Can't be a pirate without proper boots.  It complemented well the pirate- wench custome we got at the same time.  Received many complements with it.
The information provided said they were leather and they are all manmade material...somewhat disappointed because they were a gift...will be a litttle dubious about buying genuine leather products in the future.
As other reviewers have mentioned, these shoes either slip off, or your toes are crammed if you've tightened them enough to keep them on. But you can easily run some ribbon through the cut out parts to tie them on. I have a green pair and I used black grosgrain ribbon and it looks perfect and now they are absolutely comfortable.
Very nice set, outstanding customer service.  I've gotten many compliments.  They look much more expensive than they were.  Great value in my opinion.
Bought this for my wife and she absolutely LOVES IT!!!  So elegant and fun!  Everyone who sees it asks about it!  It is the hottest watch this year!  Guys, trust me...  get this for the woman in your life and you won't be sorry!  ;-)
Absolutely LOVE!! It arrived on time, in perfect condition and I got a great deal!! The size, color and quality were exactly as advertised.
These shoes are super cute, they look just like the picture. If you have ever wanted a hot and sexy blue shoe then this is the one for you. I have searched for months trying to find the right shade of navy in a shoe that is stylish and cute. Be sure to get this one while it lasts!
I love these shoes.  I work on cement floors all day & really need lots of support.  I also have tendanitis in my ankles so I have to buy good shoes.  These shoes fit the bill.  I have worn out my last pair & an now working on wearing out my second pair.  I recommend them to anyone, for everyday wear, walking or working out!
I purchased this Loop backpack mostly for a 15&#34; laptop. This is not a laptop bag in the strict sense as it has no padding in front of the rear compartment, but there is some padding in the rear portion. For under $30, however, it will suffice. It has numerous (5) compartments, including the rear compartment which adequately accomodates my 15&#34; laptop. The build quality seems good, each zipper has it's own pull, and it is quite roomy, as well as having an earphone pass-thru which is not your typical plastic-y grommet , but a fabric hidden pass-thru loop next to the phone/player (top) pocket. The front compartment contains two pockets for pens/stylus/notebook/papers and an interior hook for things such as keys or flash drive. There is no carry handle per-se, but the straps are designed in a way that they join at top in a handle- like fashion and I have found this to be suitable for either carrying comfortably or hanging. For a bag under $30 and not a Wenger with base stabilizer, I'm satisfied; expect to pay at least $40 or more for anything better.
Carhartt has gone to cost reduction....pattern is only one sided and I expect it will fade (will not know until many washes).  Old material felt it could handle any briar bush around...these feel much thinner.
I consider this product is great because it has a good variety of colors, sizes, and it is easy to get . the shipping was in a shorter time than I was expected. I  love it !!
My girl loves this thing!  Its large and in charge and has some serious weight to it.Nickel free as well, shes allergic to said metal so that's important to us.
I was looking for a wedding band that could match my solitaire J-color round diamond engagement ring.  I read the other reviews and liked the style.  It is so beautiful and really sparkles.  It matches my engagement ring perfectly.  I can't wait to wear it everyday.  The price was what sold me as was the fact the diamonds don't go all the way around.  The 7 diamonds are just enough to add that wow factor.
Bought this as a gift, and she loved it!  Looks great in person, and was a great price!  The crystal is especially nice, and the luminescent dial is easy to read, but elegant.
Great quality for the price but the size was way off. Too big all over except the white button down- the collar was too small so we couldn't close the shirt. Then we didn't use the tie. Our son isn't huge either. He was almost 7 months and is average size. Should have ordered something else...
decently made, durable (so far), comfortable rubber sole, snazzy addition to my otherwise fairly boring work attire without looking unprofessional.  these do run on the narrow side for boys shoes, size 36, which makes them a perfect fit for my girly size 6.5 feet
I normally wear 11.5M but ordered a half size based on previousl reviews.  They are still a bit too snug and I will need to return for a 12.5 to get the most out of the shoe.
The price of the Fossil watch, quality and aesthetics were all excellent, although the watch was not exactly the same as pictured (i.e. there was no dent/circle in the white background as pictured). The dial case was larger than I thought, but the watch nonetheless looks great and moreover, is easy to read. There are many holes for the strap on the leather band, which is great for a variety of wrist sizes, especially if you have a smaller wrist.
This three piece was worth the price! I ordered it for my daughter to have for winter wear. I am glad with the purchase.
This product does not only have a great fit but the quality is outstanding. This is the 3rd time we have purchased & will continue to purchase
These clips are lovely! Colors are beautiful and match any outfit that your child may have. I just loved them. It is a nice gift for friends that have baby girls.
so i finally decided to spend more for what i thought would be a better sandal. i was excited to get my first pair. after having them for a week, i have to say, what's the big deal? they are no more comfortale that any other pair i own that were half this price. one thing i like about this particular pair is the clip that allows them to be opened up for foot insertion. they are my size but seem a bit long (size 10). maybe ecco next time.
This jacket exceeded my expectations.  It was however a bit small, so I returned for larger size (with no hassle whatsoever) and had my new jacket within a week!  Exceptional service!  This jacket is so incredibly soft, warm, and comfortable and I get tons of compliments on it every time I wear it.  It was worth every penny and I would recommend it to anyone!
Nice watch.  The band is a bit stiffer than I expected.  I'm hoping it breaks in a little.  If not, I'll just replace it with a rubber one.Overall, the watch looks good.  It doesn't feel cheap and I'm please how it looks on.  I bought this to remind myself of the Nautica I bought on my honeymoon that had the flags on the outside of the crystal and wore off.
I've worn New Balance for many years, and I've gotten used to their quirky sizes. Normally I take a 10 EE; in New Balance that usually means a 11 EE. But other reviews suggested these were overlarge a bit, so I tried the 114E that was available.Well, the length wasn't  too bad, almost usable. But the 4E .... Tight. Surprisingly tight.So I sent 'em in to try my normal 11, but since 4E was tight here I didn't think I could go down in width, so I stayed with 4E. This time the length was short, but the width was better. I would have exchanged them again, for a 12 4E, but after paying return shipping TWICE I just couldn't justify taking yet another chance.
I purchased this for my brother who was keeping large bills in a paper bank envelope in the front pocket of his shirt with a sweatshirt over it. While walking at a flea market he was touched on the shoulder by the guy behind him who had watched the envelope fall from him onto the ground. My brother wanted something that would hang from his belt, but this looked like a much better idea and more versatile. Now he can attach the pouch with the large bills to his shirt and just tuck it in, retrieving the $ when necessary. He is loving it!
i love the bra but its def way to tight around. other then that its just just will have to go out and get an extender for it.
Needed a much larger jewelry box that would still match with the rest of our bedroom furniture and remain free-standing... found this through Amazon and the price seemed right. Item is very sturdy and espresso color was close enough to what I was looking for (a bit darker then our other furniture, but you can never get a perfect match). Only issue I saw was that there were some lighter worn streaks on the top cover which had seemed to be painted over with the varnish... but considering the discounted price of this product I didn't really care and could end up living with it. My only other initial issue was the overwhelming chemical varnish smell that permeated our entire bedroom when I set the item up - but after about a week of airing it out in another room, that seems to have taken care of itself. As a side note, I wish there were actual hooks to hang earrings on, this box does not offer that option... this jewelry box only has hooks for necklaces and only reserves box spaces for earrings, which if you have alot of hanging/hoop earrings (like I have)can get quite annoying with intertwining of sets. But other then that I have been pleased with my purchase.
I work in a hospital and am on my feet all day long (12-16 hrs at a time). It's nice to know that these are so comfortable and can get me through the day. I usually rotate my Nikes- but lately I only wear this pair. I definitely have to get it in a few different colors! Awesome price- awesome shoe!
This bag has lived up to my expectations. It's the perfect size for every day use, and also big enough to hold my Generation 2 Kindle. I love the cross-body style for comfort and security.
I had been looking for a reasonably priced 14kt white gold nose ring, and this seemed to fit the bill. The diamond gives off a subtle sparkle - some of my friends didn't even notice it until I purposely turned that side of my face towards them. Just a note, though: the thickness of the screw part of it is less than the kind that you get your nose pierced with. It shouldn't really matter, but if you're going to change it for another nose ring with a thicker screw (different gauge), just be sure to take a little more time to work it in. I had this nose screw for about two months before I lost it...while wiping off my face after a shower; part of the prong caught on the towel and it yanked out of my nose and flew who knows where. The setting on the diamond is a little loose (the prongs aren't all pressed down on the diamond all the way), so it caught on my towel. Sad, I know...I'm not sure if I'll buy it again (if it keeps getting caught on towels, clothes, etc, the replacement costs are going to run pretty high), but it was definitely nice to have while I had it. If you do decide to buy this, then just be careful when you're changing/showering/etc. I didn't have the problem that another review mentioned, of the stone falling out after a couple weeks, though. I'd recommend this ring, but just be very careful; the workmanship isn't 5-star (but I guess that's what you get for the price).
I bought this shirt for a number of reasons, but the main one was an up coming reunion with some of the guys I was in Vietnam. The shirt arrived on time, in good shape, caution these shirts do run big. First thing I did was wash it and starch the heck out of it like mammasan did but I can't find "monkey wood" to dry it over. LOL Love the shirt, brings back a lot of old memories.
I bought this bikini top in size 34C to wear with my pink swim skirt. The colour is bright, pretty and the cut is super sexy but very supportive. The fabric is of excellent quality.I am very happy with my bikini top and highly recommend this purchase.
I received my Samsonite 151 Series 24&#34; Spinner today.  I got it unpacked and commenced to rolling it around on my hardwood floors.  The wheels were not as smooth as I thought they would be, but they moved and turned great.  I think I expected more of a gliding feel when they moved.  Opened the suitcase up and was surprised at how much room there was.  Amazing.  I feel like I could put my kitchen sink in there.  Very roomy and a place for your shoes and it also came with a clear plastic zip up bag.  Not sure what that is for.  Love the color.  I think I'm going to like this one.  I didn't give it 5 stars, because I bought it for a trip in March and I haven't taken it yet.  Once I do I will come back and let you know how well it did in the airport.  So far I like what I see.
I really like the shine to this bead.  This is a very nice bead.  Anyone should be happy to own these beads and wear them proudly.
I ordered the black pack and have only had these socks for 2 weeks and I have already developed a hole in the end of one.  I have only worn that pair twice.  My toenails are not long and I have never had this problem with socks before.  I like the way they fit and look with my flats, but if they only last for two uses, it is definitely not worth the money.  I am very disappointed in the quality of this product.
girls friend loved it .... she was pumped great first belly chain to get to see if they like it or not before spending 100 bucks on one.
Bought this ring on a whim.  I get nothing but compliments on this all day long.  The color is gorgeous and looks great with a little tan too.  This is also the perfect accessory for a pop of color!
It's is the third pair of shoes that I have had of this design. This seems to be the best of the lot.  Love the insoles, see to be some sort of memory foam.Be advised that they definitely run a bit wide. I normally wear a wide shoe, but based on reviews I ordered a normal width.  Fit perfectly.  One other thing.  When you first put these on, you'll swear they are too long. Wear them for a day, and let the heel conform to your foot.
I have the worst luck with hats. The biggest flexfit size that is commonly available (L/XL) is just barely too small...enough so that it gives me a terrible headache. Fitted hats that are not flexfit are becoming less common. I initially ordered this hat in an XL, thinking that it would be just right. It was actually way too big. I sent it back for the large, which was PERFECT. If your head is slightly too big for a L/XL flexfit, get this in a large. It gits PERFECT. It keeps its shape quite well. I'm definitely getting one in every single color. LOVE LOVE LOVE.
I bought this watch to replace a timex ironman watch whose strap had fallen off and could not be put back on. This one seems well made (I don't think the straps will fall off), colors are nice, the large numbers are a good feature (even though they make for a larger watch). I also like that there is no button on the face of the watch. I've had it for a few weeks and it has worked well for biking, swimming and running. My only complaint is that it seems large for a woman's watch (though I am very small so I imagine this would not be an issue for most women), certainly much bigger than the timex ironman women's watches I've had in the past.
I bought two of these shirts to sleep in. I like to sleep in a shirt with a built-in bra because I find it more comfortable. I ordered size medium and, like many other reviews have stated, it was a bit tighter than a normal medium would be, but it was just what I was looking for. For reference, I am 5'5, 135 lbs, 36D. The medium is very comfortable for sleeping, but it's tight enough that I would never wear it out in public unless it was as an under shirt. And of course, the &#34;built in bra&#34; is exactly what you'd expect -- just extra fabric with an elastic band underneath. So we busty gals would def need to wear a bra with it if you're wearing it out. Unless you're not into that, to each her own! Anyway, I'm happy with this purchase. You should definitely order a size up from what you'd normally get, or 2 sizes up if you don't want it skin tight.
I bought these for my daughter for her birthday to run the 2013 NYC Marathon.  She finished.  She wanted the purple but they weren't available.
I had another pair of Keds and thought it would be same size. NOT...disappointed. Then noticed that the KEDS all have different names. That is the way it goes sometimes.
I love these pants so much!! I'm going to be wearing them constantly. They fit amazingly. I'm a size 0, I'm a very petite teen. so It's very hard for me to find pants that fit my tiny waist and legs.I was hesitant ordering these but I thought I would give it a shot, because lets face it, It's not everyday you find pants that look like this. So I ordered them and I was amazed. I was so excited cause they actually fit me!!! (:I love wallflower jeans. I will be ordering more of them soon.I highly recommand these pants! Don't think about it, just order them. You know you wanna (;
I get compliments on these shoes!  I wanted a ballet flat with a little jazz and this fit the bill. The cusioned insole feels great, I can wear them all day.
At first, I thought these boots were identical to the taller version I use most of the year.  Then I looked more closely at the bottom (much more tread) and the interior.  The inside is not as &#34;fleecy&#34; as I expected, but the boots fit well so I tried them on a mile plus hike in 10 inch or so snow yesterday wearing my usual, rather thin, nylon socks (carrying back ups in case!).  These boots were great.  Comfortable when walking.  WARM!  I was very pleased!  Muck boots are worth the price any time, but these are outstanding for winter wear!
I purchased this bag in the pewter color after seeing someone with the printed version.  First off in terms of color, I love the pewter which is a great neutral color to go with everything.  I also like the contrasting lining which is a yellow color that makes everything very visible in the bag.  No more digging into the abyss of a purse looking for something.Another great feature of this bag is all the pockets on the outside.  I used this for vacation and it was great to be able to stick my water bottle on the side.  I also could use the other side pocket for my sunglasses and camera.  Everything stayed put easily but was at my fingertips when I wanted it.The size of this purse is great.  Not to big for me as I am used to carrying a tote for all my essentials.  I could fit all my stuff along with my hubby's wallet and young daughter's items in this pocketbook.This is my first Baggallini purse but will certainly not be my last.
Great comfort and fit.  They come out of the wash looking brand new.  Very soft fabric with good "give".  Perfect for yoga.Just a little too long, but I can live with that.  I would definitely recommend them and would buy again.
Perfect size for most airlines, fits quite a bit of stuff, just wish it had another outside pocket. However the front pocket allows me to slide my laptop in front.
I bought this watch for my wife and she really loves it . I got it on a lightning deal from Amazon . I checked all the websites at the time and found out that this watch was over a thousand dollars ... it's a shame that not even a week after I purchased it the price went down dramatically . Anyway I'm happy that I only payed $200 for it and the wife is happy with it . happy wife ,happy life . Thank you Amazon for the merchandise and Gevril for creating another masterpiece
Super soft, warm, and lightweight - gave it 4 because there were a few loose threads that made it look a little cheap when it arrived - snipped them and they haven't returned. Would give it a 4.5 if I could.
Felt cheep.  It is not as warm as I thought it should be considering it is the storm fleece.  I did keep it for my husband.  It does run a bit small, so order up.
I loved the earrings. They were beautiful. But the silver back broke after wearing them once.I returned the earrings and still waiting for another pair, even exchange.
I really love these shoes comfort level.I m a big and tall guy who is always up and down roofs,these shoe provide great support and comfort.There is only a bit of issue when the soles get wet.They get a little slippery.But they are supper great in all other aspect,also your feet are  ventilated and cool through out the day.
I've had lower back pain for sometime. Discovered Asics about a year ago and their running shoes really helped. Back really got stiff after golf so I tried them and no stiff back after I play.
The packaging was weird.  The were pack loose and not in a actual package.  Other than that no problems with the socks.
I bought this necklace and earring set for my vow renewal. I was hesitant because of the super low price...I did not want something that looked cheap.  I was pleasantly surprised. I got much more than I paid for!  The necklace has an expensive look and nice weight. The stones are perfectly clear and shimmer beautifully. The earrings are okay..they have the same quality as the necklace, but do not detract from it. The bonus bracelet, though, is a cheapy toss-in. It is not bride quality, but was perfect for my pre-teen daughter.
I love  the dress as the Grim Reaper for Halloween, but have not done so in a while.  Most of the costumes on-line or in stores are so ordinary and cheaply made.  Not this one!.  The mask looks so authentic, given the jaw moves an the design is very detailed.  I used pieces of black hosiery to cover the eye sockets, to complete the nefarious effect. The outfit itself was so much more than I expected.  Heavy, high quality materials were used, including the rope sash.  The tattered sleeves and pant legs were also very well done.  I got rave reviews with this costume!  Highly recommend it!  Worth every penny!  Be warned that because it is so well made, with heavy materials, it is warm to wear, so no need to wear heavy clothing underneath.
I love this dress, it is so feminine and fits great! It is quite well made and I like it so much, I bought it in another color too!
These are very well made socks, but for the price, I expect the fit to be perfect.  I wear size 13 and ordered the XL socks.  The quality is good, and you can't beat their lifetime guarantee, but they are very tight across the front of my ankle.  I have to really stretch the material out to get them to feel OK.  By the end of the day they stretch out and fit, but the first couple hours are a little uncomfortable.
This is a good chronograph watch with all the major functions I wanted. It goes well with casual looks as well as dressy looks. The watch is a bit heavy, but I like heavy watches so this is not a negetive for me. The band is comfortable and clasp closes securely.
This is a fine product but I thought there would be 14 of them based on the item title. FYI: You only get 1. The title is misleading.
I bought this beach bag after doing much research deciding what bag would fit everything I needed for a family with children.  This bag is great!  We can easily fit 4 or more beach towels in it, multiple containers of suntan lotion, water bottles, cell phones, camera, etc and still have room to spare!  I would recommend this beach bag to any family - you won't be disappointed!
Great medium sized summer tote bag, as described on Amazon. Using it for my trip to Hawaii, later this summer.
These camis are one of my favorite finds on Amazon.  I was hesitant of the one size fits all, but I am 5'4" and weigh about 115 pounds and these fit perfectly.  Initially, I ordered them in two colors.  Four of five months later, they still look great.  The colors I have are pretty and bold, so it is easy to add something extra to the outfit by layering.  They have held up to wear and washing without fading, stretching, or knotting.  A pet peeve of mine is material that collects lint and these camis pass the test with flying colors.
I ordered this bra to wear under my thin strap and strapless shirts.  It is very comfortable and fits very well.  I would recommend it to any woman who is looking for a good, strapless bra that offers support.
I ordered these snowpants so they would be big on her.  There weren't any snowpants that were her size or price either.  She will grow into these snowpants, plus these snowpants have adjustable straps.  The snowpants zip in the front and the side zipper is only on the bottom of the pants on the side and comes up maybe 6-12 inches and has another lining under the pants it self in the area where it zips and unzips down on the bottom so that the child can get there pants in the boot and then put the snowpants over the boot.
I have been looking for a pair of shearling slippers for a long time. After plenty of research I decided to try the Tamarac slippers. They are awesome. Ordered my standard shoe size 9 wide and they fit perfectly. Keeps my feet warm and keeps the sweat away from my feet when they get warm.
A proper watch, very comfortable, easy to read. Nice size, not a pompous monstrosity. If you need a business causal watch, this fits the bill. I could not be happier.
These also have no tags, and are nicely tight fitting. I'm a slim 6'0&#34; and the Large fits snugly. They are really long if you have a hotty girlfriend that needs a nighty, lol
Definitely not what I expected. It's too bulky and the size is way too large. So when you order it should be an inch smaller than your actual size. I will not be able to wear it at all. What a shame!
Exelentt, this is my favourtite watch, i love it. i use it everydayy!!! its Really cool and stylish, i get a lot of compliments about itt!!!
Shoe is exactly like the picture. Amazons Shipping was Excellent, brought on 25/07 received on 30/07.It was a gamble getting size 11 as that's my normal shoe size. Shoes fits good would possibly be better a half size down.Packaging was good, only minor tear in the shoe box itself.Will be definitely be getting more.
I bought these for my granddaughter. She has just learned to walk and like when my kids were learning to walk, you buy only the best for their feet to start them out right!  So her first two pairs of shoes have been Stride Rite!!
I am dissatisfied with the quality of the article, the same when using a third time detached white front indicates the minutes. the quality is not good
The fabric is very thick and keeps the clothing from pulling in directions where the snaps are. I've found that to be a problem with some of these kimono style onesies.
CAUTIONARY VENDOR TALE FIRST: (Please see addendum below, they made good on the order!)I received my Sanita clogs in great time--especially considering they were ordered the Friday before Memorial Day! They arrived, I excitedly opened the box, and was horrified to discover that even though they are leather lined, they are fabric covered! The description is very misleading because it says "leather uppers" and doesn't mention textile ANYWHERE. The online view didn't allow me to zoom in to see the details of the product before ordering, it's very misleading. So ordering them was a bit of a risk in the first place. That's not the worst, though. There was a crack in the sole and the paint was peeling off the staples and the soles looked worn. There were sold as new! Because the item isn't specifically sold by Amazon, I may possibly NOT get a refund because defect refunds are at the discretion of the seller. So yes, please beware of the vendor--European Walking Store. They have high customer satisfaction rating, but I'm a little less than pleased with them. So ZERO STARS FOR THE VENDOR.Sanita Prof Zina closed orange clogs review:They are beautiful clogs! VERY unique! Please be informed that they are fabric covered, so if being purchased for work, don't wear them if they could get things spilled on them because clean up will be crazy. Especially if you're in food service or are a nurse. My son told me to get some spray plastic for them :-D or OR booties. *sigh*Anyway. They are the coolest clogs I've ever seen anywhere and they fit like they were made for me. If they weren't defective, I'd keep them. Order up a size for sure--I wear a 10.5-11 in US sizes, and ordered a 42 and they fit perfectly. Something to also remember with closed clogs is that you DON'T want the back to fit snug against the heel--there should be a gap. If you have a profession where you're on your feet all day, I highly, highly recommend this brand (Sanita). A takes just a short while to adjust to the arch, but it's really fantastic. Just be careful of the vendor (European Walking Store)!IMPORTANT ADDENDUM: I sent these clogs back, received a $10 "we're very sorry" credit from European Walking Store, and was able to replace my order. They were very prompt with replying to any questions I had about the order, very courteous in all ways--over the phone and with e-mail. The replacement clogs were in great shape in every way, also. THANK YOU!!!!
The halo is ok.  The picture included more colors that the actual product.It did arrive quickly.
Great set. I bought these for me and my girlfriend for Christmas and they came two weeks earlier than expected. They are very well made the chain is a good length and good on the eyes. My girlfriend and I have been wearing them ever since a and we love them
These are really great shirts. They are soft, true to size, and very comfortable. I bought three, and I'm so happy with them, I plan to buy more colors.
I was pleased with the promptness of delivery and the packaging of these products. Thank you.
I knew when I saw it that is would be mine!  It is very nice and not overly revealing.  It does hug your curves nicely but you must order the right size!  I wasn't sure at first to get a medium or a large, so I went with the large and it is still tight on me (a couple of weeks of working out I will shrink pretty easy :).  I am 5'5 164 lbs. 36D hip 41' waist 31'.  I have broad shoulders as well so it was tight in the shoulders and in the hips  but like the other reviewers said the material is stretchy, I can still wear the costume just fine so I will not return it because it still looks so good!The headband is alright but I desired full round horns, so I ordered my own fancy horns from another site.  I am thinking of getting it altered around the shoulders and purple sequined neck area.  I want the "V" neck to be lower in the front to show of my "girls" more too.  Since I ordered my own horns I can use the extra fabric from the horns on the headband to use on my shoulder area and lower the V pretty easy so no biggie.  It is a long dress but with platform heels it is still long, for me I loved it dragging the floor a bit it gives the you a Queenly feel when you walk in it and I loved it like that. I had no problems walking in it or stepping on it (remember the dress fits your curves and the open front gives you room to move).  I am happy and can't wait to make it my own and wear it out!
This item is everything it was advertised to be.  W/we like it a lot.
Very pleased with this stuff, went on easily, and rinsed off easily leaving clean silver.  And some of my jewelry was really really tarnished...not anymore, and a little goes a long way, that tube will last me for 10 years easily
very nice a true representation of the sixtys and of woodstock would have liked a little thicker material to be on the safe side I recommend not putting it in the dryer I've worn it several times and got lots of compliments
The watch was beautiful except it said &#34;ichael Kors&#34; not &#34;Michael Kors&#34; on the face! Is Savvy Watch selling irregular or fake watches? I don't know but it ruined my daughters Christmas gift!
These leg warmers barely stretch around my calves; they are way too tight! I can't get them as high up on my legs as they are shown on the mannequin legs in the picture, and I definitely could never fit them on over leggings. I'm not stick-and-bones thin but most people consider me pretty small (for a frame of reference, in Express jeans I am usually a size 2-short). So I can't imagine too many adult women fitting into these unless they have those long, slender model-legs. They should probably be marketed as children's leggings, instead of "women's legwarmer" as they are labeled currently. On a positive note, they do look just like the picture. It's a shame they have to be so tight.
Good quality, style is also good, size is unclear, but the husband wear small, return very trouble, forget it, be careful next time.
Very well made jacket at a great price.  I'm very satisfied with the fit and finish.  With regard to sizes, I noticed a trend in the other reviews I read.  Those that had trouble with the sizes, saying they tend to run small, were those individuals in the multiple extra large categories.  For people like myself who wear a medium, the sizes tend to run more true.  If I had taken their advice and ordered a large, I would have ended up sending it back for a medium. A large would have been much to big. So, I'm glad I noticed that trend in the reviews and ordered my normal size medium.Nice motorcycle jacket.  I highly recommend it.
If you have 2 right hands this is the glove for you.  Poor quality and thin.  The two right hands were also 2 different sizes.
It is true that you get what you pay for. Look closely at the picture (3 button front) without anchors. No rear vent. Light material. Get a real one at SchottNYC.com for more cost but well worth it! Wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants anything but a budget coat.
I've had this for 6 years, and originally bought it for airsofting (paintball but more realistic). I modified airsoft guns a lot and needed to be able to get a speed reading before hitting the field to make sure I'd be within field regulations. Airsoft speeds range from 250-600fps. These days I've put various 9mm and 12ga shotgun loads over it and it works like a charm, even in the case of bird and buck shot where you have multiple projectiles.I lost the light diffuser arches years ago, which does make it just a little tougher to use, but once you get used to what it wants for light, you can learn how to use it with or without them. It's not hard.My F-1 Chrono has been tossed into and out of boxes, karted around on the airsoft field and the shooting range, and has been through a lot of abuse. The metal is bent in a few places and the plastic protecting the screen has come off from being hit a few times with airsoft bbs, but it still works great.Only down side I've ever noticed is that it seems to slowly drain its 9V battery if you leave the battery plug hooked up when it's in storage. The battery is exposed inside the unit though, so it's a 2-second thing to disconnect it. Not a big enough deal to sway my 5-star rating.Buy one if you want to know how fast stuff is flying!
I like this watch because it is exactly what I was looking for, and as described on the website..I was very pleased.
Curvation Posture Underwire Bra (5304628)I love Curvations bras.  They fit well, are comfortable, wash well and wear well.  I like the convenience of being able to order them online.
Casio has a great product here.  It is easy to set and easy to go through the menus of the watch.  I love it.
The blue really isn't as vivid as in the picture. But my boyfriend liked it so I have no complaints.
The Rick Steves Silk Money Belt was worn by my husband.  He said that it was easy to wear, had just the right number of compartments, no probelm with airline security.  It made us feel that our passports, credit cards, and money, were all safe from pickpockets when travelling around in Europe.
this wig made my Katy Perry outfit for Halloween - the perfect shade of blue
I like them very much, but thought they would be a little bit more comfortable than they are, being that they are aerosoles. But they are comfortable.
DD#3 needed a chess set to take to chess club.  This is great and a great color for her too.
It was the size of a small handbag. not sure what the point of a bag this small is. I did read the HxWxL but dont think they match.
This necklace is super sweet & simple :) Love it & totally recommend it...great price too...only negative is the chain seems a little dainty for me, but I decided to keep it anyways!
I have adored all my Wave shoes in various models so I was looking forward to getting the same incredible comfort in a sandal.  I ordered my normal size but the instep strap was too narrow and cut into my forefoot.  I am sure that if I had had somewhat narrower feet I would have cherished these as I have my other Waves.
I don't know if the amber necklace has had an effect on my nursing baby but I do like the way it looks and how sturdy it is. My baby and toddler pull on it and it has held up to all the attention. The clamp is easy to do and the necklace is smooth and the stones are nice. So far so good!
OMg, they had this on sale for [...] this averaged $25 bucks for me. Now the price is up. this shoe is cute, only thing that sucks is that it comes in only whole sizes. I wasn't sure if i should go a 7 or 8. I did go for a 7 and while i have about a 1/4 or so of my foot hanging out in the back, the thing at the back doesn't make it visisble. The straps aren't stiff so you don't have to worry about them cutting into your foot, and the sole isn't hard and uncomfortable like the ones i've seen at aldos or bakers. if you're a 7.5, you may want to order an 8 or if your feet isn't a true 7.5, you can order a 7m. Even if a little bith of your feet hangs in the back, no one will see it.These shoes are easy to walk it. The khaki one is a little metallic. i think it has a lot more shine than i'd like but it's not soo much that i can't wear these shoes casually with a pair of shorts or dress.All in all, i like them. Not sure if i'd pay the full msrp for them but with some discount, they'll set you apart from the cheap look alikes you'll see at the stores in the mall.Oh, i think a person with wide or borderline wide foot can wear these. the straps are soo adjustaple.
The bag smells like it is stale.  I like the size of it, but haven't used it yet.Trying to figure out how to get rid of the smell before using it.  Right nowit is sitting in my trunk.
It was a bit too large for me and and I should have returned it but I needed it for a trip to Mexico. I used skin tape to keep the bra area from revealing too much. It's really a pretty dress. It runs big so order smaller. It is a great dress if you have large breasts. Mine were a bit too small for it.
I was so pleased with the silver Menorah I bought from Sabrina Silver a year or so ago I thought I would check out their  Star of David.  It was even better than I anticipated.  The picture doesn't do it justice.  The cut of the silver really makes it shine.  Just the right size and a great price!  I will likely buy more for gifts.
so hard to find all leather sandals, hate the manmade leather shoes. these sandals are amazing, comfy and will last!!!
But the metal is nice and heavy, good quality. The leather could be more supple, but that'll just take some wearing!
Very sturdy and razonable price for the quality. The made materials are first grade and the duffle are exceptional product.
I bought these for my guy ane he loves them.  He says they are very comfortable, soft and the fit is perfect.
whenever i wear this ring, i always get compliments....  it's lovely, the nother of pearl has a soft glow, and it's easy and comfortable to wear!
Purple is my favorite color so it didn't take long for me to decide to purchase this.  It has a great feel and looks just like the picture.  I always knock my wrist but it has not cracked or scratched and I have had many inquiries about where I got it!Keeps time perfectly so far!Great value and super cute!
The top of the cap is not lined. Only the flaps are lined. Size is smaller than expected. I can't wear it. I am not happy with this purchase.
The show were not well made at all... Some of the chains were loose before I was able to put them on and the were not comfortable at all... I probably won't were them ever again....
It is a beautiful bra but cup on the small side. Since it is a maternity/nursing bra one would think it would be based on you pre-nursing size. well it is not. you have to go a bit bigger (at least a cup size) to account for you added milk supply. Total bummer for me cuz now I have a bra that I bulge out in unless I have just feed or pumped.
I loved these pumps. I ordered them overnight delivery for my daughter's christening. They were comfortable and the rubber sole made me confident that I could move around quickly and comfortably while holding my young daughter. The fit was true to size and for smacking brand new shoes on and going that day...NO BLISTERS! I would recommend these pumps to a friend and I intend on purchasing more in diff colors.
A few months ago I was looking to transition into minimalist running shoes for a variety of reasons.  However, I tried to transition too fast and ended up with tendonitis in my ankle.  Just recently I discovered the Asics 33 line and a friend gave me a pair of Blurs to try.  I absolutely love them.  They are a minimalist style shoe with a enough cushioning to enable a smooth transition to an even more minimal shoe, or to use if you are the type of runner that needs a little more cushioning than barefoot running, or runs on pavement a lot.  These are also great shoes for the gym.
I normally don't write reviews about products, but these boots exceeded my expectations. They feel light on your feet, very sturdy, and are incredibly comfortable. Easy on and off. I am very satisfied with this purchase and am considering getting a second pair (in black).
Perfect pair of shorts for the &#34;big guy.&#34;  He always wants pockets in whatever he is wearing & likes the wide waistbands not the drawstring bands. This fit the bill perfectly!
I like them. Though nicely padded and flexible, I don't think I could stand for too long on these or walk longer than 5000 steps, other than that I am happy with them.Delivery of them was great, they came quickly. Thank you.
great thongs and very comfortable, it takes a little bit for your feet to get used them, so go for short walks in the beginning. The only downfall, I have pretty narrow feet and where a size 9, these are just a hair too big and my contribute to awkward rubbing that occurs after a longer walk, but beyond that, i love them! And i swear I feel a slight soreness in my hips and quads after!!
My grandson's favorite color is green.  He picked these Lego Crocs out himself.  They were true to size and he loves them.  We got many nice compliments wherever he wore them.  Like most Crocs, these are easy to put on, so he doesn't have to struggle with laces or complicated straps.  He just slips them on and away we go.
It was very sparkly and shiny but shortly after wearing the chain it started to turn yellow. Disappointing. I wouldn't recommend purchasing it.
These were water proof, warm and attractive. They met all the criteria. They will work perfect. Now have to order two more pair for others.
I am wearing my ring now. I bought it as an alternative to wearing my wedding ring set. I don't like wearing my big diamond ring when its raining or snowing because I am afraid it might fall off. So i ordered this as an alternative. I'm very happy with it. It looks exactly like the picture. The diamonds go all the way around. It is great quality for the price. I recommend it.
When I had to ask the seller a question, I got a response right away and I received my shoes promptly and I love them! I would definately buy from this seller again.
i orderd this hat as a camping hat it fits like a glove the quality is perfect looks authentic and is perfect for the family history buff
Make sure when you order you get a size at least one or two sizes bigger. Normally I wear a 9 and a half so I ordered at 10. They were way too small. When I went to return them, I called the company and they said I needed to return them in the box they came in, but I had thrown it out. It cost me $12 to return the shoes. In order to get a new pair I had to pay again $6 for the shipping so all in all it became a pain and very costly.This is the second pair I have worn for zumba and they work well and are more stylish than other zumba shoes.
Even though the sizei ordered was 14 and I am a 12, I didn't mind at all. I figured its not as bad. I really love the color and the design, it's appropriate and it's not something my grand kids will ask grandma what are you wearing that for?
This watch is really easy to use as well as stylish. There is also a strong back light on the watch which is really handy and the watch itself is light but seems durable. Overall I am really pleased with the purchase!!!
Looks and feels great  absolutely love it  tempted to get two more coolibars
I ordered this ring as a substitute for my diamond wedding band because I was going on a deployment to Afghanistan.  This is an absolutely lovely ring!  It fits perfect and is very sturdy.  The detail/design on this ring is beautiful.  You cannot even tell it was an inexpensive ring.  If you are on the fence between this ring and another one, go with this one, you will not be disappointed.
This purse is too flimsy,  it's like you put it down and the whole purse falls,like a body that goes limpThe color is georgous, inside purse storage is great, but the body of the purse is limp
This is the worst item of clothing I ever purchased. It's proportions are completely off it's too narrow and extremely long. It's not a sweatshirt because it's material is paper thin. It's not worth returning because shipping would cost more than it's worth. I would just keep it for pajamas but it's not even soft. I'll give it to my husband for a car rag.
I really love this shoe. It is really beautiful, like most Sam Edelman shoes. The only problem I have with this shoe is that the fit is somewhat tight. This is my fifth Sam Edelman purchase, and one thing I have learned from this brand, is the inconsistancy of the sizing. My Sam Edelman boots are in a size 6.5, my sam edelman sandals are size 7.5. I ordered a pair of wedge sandals in 7.5 and they were huge, and this pump I ordered in a 7 and it is tight. Certainly is confusing when trying to order multiple shoes from this brand. Nevertheless, this shoe is gorgeous, but you may have to return/try different sizes to find the correct one. For the price though, and the ease of ordering through Amazon, I would still recommend them.
My granddaughter asked for Sketchers sparkle toes for Christmas.  I had to google it to find out what they were!  Amazon made it easy for me to order, and they were delivered right on time.  These shoes made my grandchild's eyes sparkle as brightly as her new Sketchers!  Now I have to order my other granddaughter a pair for her birthday!
I loved this shirt! It runs a little small, so I had to get the med/lg. and it was perfect.
These shoes are great. Walked all over NYC and no foot problem. Love these shoes and own several pairs of them..
I'm not sure if this is a problem only with the Black color bracelet, but what was shown in the product photos was not what was shipped to me. My bracelet came to me with larger gems and they were spaced apart far enough that you could see the bead's surface (which was either plastic or wood). The product photos show a bead that is completely covered encrusted. See my customer photos to see what I mean and to compare with Amazon's photos. This wasn't nearly as nice as I expected.
NOTHING CAN EVER TAKE THE PLACE OF A TRIED & TRUE PAIR OF CHUCK TAYLOR ALL-STARS. (WE CALLED THEM BO-BOS IN THE 70'S)
The top has no darts in the chest area and the pants don't fit well in the seat.  It's as if this set was made for a very large child!
From the moment I opened the box and put the straps over my shoulder, I knew this was the bag.  I ordered black which is more of a charcoal gray and goes with everything. There is another model which looks very similar but has larger dimensions.  I find it easier to find my things because there is only one zippered pocket.  In bags that have tons of pockets inside and out, I can never remember where I put my things.  I end up looking in ten places before I find my keys.  The quality is amazing.  My biggest dilemma was deciding on the color.The reviews were very helpful in deciding on this bag.
i wear these under my jeans with holes, so i can still enjoy my favorite jeans
I bought this as a first jewelry piece for my 11 year old daughter. I wanted something timeless that she would be able to wear for a long time. I thought this initial disc was attractive and well made. I had looked around on line for a long time to find this and really believe it is a great bargain for the money. After I purchased I saw that it was available without the diamonds for aprox. $40 less but the diamonds really look great and add alot of sparkle. I highly reccommmend this pendant.
vegan professional striped- 38 is too big and would need 2 pairs of thick socks and heel slips out, 37 is too small and would only be able to use a very thin sock....hmmmm. advice anyone? i wear a solid 7.5 in most shoes.
These shoes are made well with great quality leather. They fit true to size and they are cushioned on the inside. The cut out by the ankle is very sassy. The colour is like a creamy butter and is perfect as neutral. The wedge is comfortable. You do not need any insoles for these shoes. All shoes/pumps/sandals by Corso Como are cushioned to perfection in all the right places.
Excellent.  Fits both a pad of paper and an iPad 2.  Lots of slots, pen holder and great looking design (crisp and professional).Great value for the money.  And it fits in a laptop bag easily.  Highly recommended.
Like other reviewers, these duffle bags (of any size) do not stand upright when fully packed.  However, I would buy them over again as they perform like troopers.  Airlines didn't damage them, train trips didn't damage them, luggage handlers and hotel bellmen threw them around with abandon and not a mark, scuff, fray or break.  All over England and Scotland I stuffed and restuffed them to the point of zipper failure, but the zippers did not fail!  The rolling mechanism is smooth and strong, even when I stacked a smaller bag on top.  There are handles everywhere you need one, and external and internal pockets to use or not.  Easy to find on the carousel.  Recommend them highly.
Fits great and has a high quality look. My dad wears it on the boat and gets tons of honks from fellow boaters!!
I waited to do my review because I wanted to be sure I was giving a real review. The ring is beautiful and shines very well. I always get compliments. Fits well, sized perfectly. The stones are all in tact. Love the ring. Great purchase.
Too Tight Thru The Toe. Tried To Stretch. No Luck.Not Leather. Very Pretty Boots. To Bad I Can't Return Them
as the other reviewer told , not very shiny as it looks in the picture , jewellery set looks very tiny. to be honest both the earring and pendant looks same in size . i would wait for response from my wife and then decide whether to keep it or not , for me 3* .
These are nice looking shoes, and quite comfortable.  They seem more of a casual shoe than a sports shoe to me, as they have little support and the sole feels pretty soft and thin - not really supportive.  I have received compliments on the appearance of these shoes.The one thing that I personally did not like was a little flap at the heel.  I did  not see it in the pictures, but there is a loose piece of leather located right at the achilles tendon.  I really didn't like it flopping around, so I actually ended up gluing it down - it bothered me that much.  It clearly a part of the design of this shoe, but one that I was not expecting nor desiring.
I purchased 3 pairs of these from Dick's Sporting Goods and they're the only pants my son wears.  He's very particular about the feel of pants and these have held up well for the past 15 months that we've had them.  After a growth spurt, my son is now 5'10&#34; and the men's size small pants are too short for him.  I did find some similar pants that are sold on Amazon which are called the Under Armour Reflex Warm-up Pants.  My son tried on the Men's Small at Dick's Sporting Goods and they are much longer.  It's the same material, but with a wider waist band, much deeper pockets and at least 2&#34; longer.  If you are taller or have a son that needs room to grow, you'll definitely want to go with the Under Armour Reflex Warm-up Pants. The price at Dick's was $39.99 too.  I'm thinking Under Armour may have replaced last years version for the Reflex since I wasn't able to find any of the kind I bought last year in the store.
This is a beautiful chain but you need to know that the thickness and style make it lay in a distinct circle around your neck. Even with a pendant on it, it retains its shape. So the effective length of the chain is actually a little shorter than a more fluid chain would give you. I don't regret purchasing it. The seller was great to work with and it is very pretty and was well priced, but it is a little different than I expected and was looking for. Guess I'll have to get an 18" chain shortened a bit to hang at the right spot, but I'll enjoy having this as well.
This is a nice, all-around versatile bag.  Nothing stunning but works with everything and it is just the right size.
This definitely functions okay as a wallet but the material is really flimsy. I worry how safe my husband's money is in there!
This necklace is so pretty but super cheap(not price wise). I loved how it's a replica of the one form the drama but this pendent will not even last a week its so cheap it gets stained pink quickly. I had to purchased a real sterling silver chain beacuse the one it came with turned pink and it was also really short. the pendent turned pink aswell but I still wear it since it was just the back of the star and moon that is stained. i love the fact that this is like the one from the drama and also I love the meaning behind this wecklace, but trust me this is not worth your money. :(
I bought these in the tan color a couple years ago and love them so much I ordered the black this year.  I use a shoe horn to get them on and right out of the box they are perfectly comfortable to wear all day and night.  I do not have a high arch and that might make it hard for some to put them on I suppose.  They are like wearing my favorite fit flop sandal except my feet are warm, I highly recommend them if you love your sandals. My feet never get tired in them!
Got this as a gift for my brother, and it looks great! Seems to be good quality, and size was as expected. Haven't washed it, but looks like it'll hold up. Only complaint is that whatever they use to print the image on the shirt smells awful when you first open it up, but I hung it up for a few days and it went away. Same thing happened with the other LOTR shirt I ordered on here.
This out fit is well made. The skirt should be hand washed separately from clothes that you don't want wearing bits of it afterwards. It is surprisingly versatile. The skirt and blouse can be worn with tights instead of the pants. The skirt is not too short. The set was priced at 10.25. It was a great bargain.
I have been extremely pleased with this ring box.  It looks nice and the open window allows me to choose the ring I want to wear even before I open the box.  I love it.
Have no complaints about these boots. They are versatile and easy to get on and off. They've been water resistant and warm so far this winter.
This was for a Christmas present.  Unfortunately it arrived broken.  However, after Christmas it was a simple matter of contacting Amazon for the return.  Pretty easy to return.  We ended up buying a similar watch (they couldn't offer me the same model : ( so we got a similar one from the same manufacturer and it worked fine)  Maybe I just got the only lemon?  I don't know.  I guess it was my bad for not opening the box and checking to make sure the watch worked before I gave it to my son for Christmas.
I wanted to love these shoes, but after playing in them a few times now and having a cramp in my foot from the twisting they just fit a bit big in the toe-box area then I had hoped... I love ASIC - have other runners and tennis shoes - but I wanted this color... so took a chance ... I guess I just need a more fitted / thinner foot box.I will keep wearing just cause I like the color and my tennis isn't good enough to cause issues with my feet!!
I really love these earrings.  They look fantastic!  I have gotten several compliments.  They are lightweight and don't weigh down your ears.
The shirt was just as it looked online. Great quality shirt. It arrived on time and i had no problems. Love it:)
I have consistently used Anime themed messenger bags as my school bags. After my Code Geass bag got too beat up and ragged from overuse (including being flooded with Dr. Pepper), I used a more conventional messenger bag. Since then, I have been searching for another Anime themed messenger bag. I bought this because the design is not overtly geeky while still very recognizable to anyone who has watched Tsubasa. The Tsubasa series was interesting a enjoyable from the beginning, but I would not say it was one of my favorite series. In truth, I would have liked a Gurren Lagann themed bag, but the selection was not as attractive.There is a slight transition from moving my stuff from a conventional bag to this product. The bag is definitely smaller than I imagined, but I could still fit my binder into the bag horizontally as I normally do. However, it is a bit of a squeeze and if I needed to take ou my binder a lot then it might be problematic. The bag does fit everything that I wanted it to fit which includes my netbook, charger and mouse. It is nice that there is a segregating flap in the main pocket. There were some nice surprises such as some button straps that can be rearranged to open up the capacity of the bag and also the Tsubasa logo on the front of the bag is sewn on rather than a decal like my old Code Geass bag. There is also a big pocket in the back of the bag which opens and closes with just a button, but I have yet to think of a use for it as anything I put in there may feel uncomfortable against my back when I'm wearing it.One more complaint is that I was under the impression that the shoulder strap of the bag is suppose to have some written decoration according to the Amazon pictures, but there was none on mine.Note: I have owned this bag for all of a few hours, so this is pretty much just a first impression. I may update this review if any problems arise.
If you are petite you might be ok. I normally wear a M for shirts so will get L for sweatshirts. Ordered a XL for this and the sleeves were too short and tight (forget layering). The shoulders were tight also. Got to figure out what to do with it now.
I purchased these for my 18 yr old for Christmas.  I cannot tell you how many shoes he's gone through since he took up skateboarding....maybe 4 pairs in 4 months.And, although winter is upon us now, the shoes have lasted thus far.  Additionally, my son has had many compliments on his shoes from his skateboard buddies.  He can't believe I was so clever as to purchase an 'in' pair of skateboarding shoes.It has been over a month and a half and the shoes are still in good shape.  I am happy w/my purchase.Update.. The shoes lasted from Christmas until June.  Given that he is a skateboarding fiend - this is a long time. The shoes really take a beating...shoes vs. concrete- concrete will eventually win.  I have purchased another pair.  If they also last six months, I believe that's a quality shoe.
They shipped and arrived when they said they would. Great quality and fit great. Would recommend them to anyone to buy!!
My fiance and I purchased two of the Princess Flower Girl Party Dresses and were extremely satisfied with the quality and appearance of both of them.  Now our little girls will be able to look like princesses for our wedding.  A feature we liked was the blue rose; its detachable.  We couldn't be more satisfied.
I had ordered this item in black but got navy blue instead.  I contacted the seller and they said to send it back and they would sent out the correct color.  I hadn't done that to this point b/c of time.  I don't have the extra time to go to the Post Office to return.  I am using them in blue for now.
Despite the pretty high heel these shoes are comfortable.I usually wear 11 in Nine West, these 11 fit true to size.
I thought I was getting style 3488, which is what I bought at a local store and love. But this is 3484, not at all the same. Differences:3488:Slightly padded cups so your nipples don't show throughSeems to be slightly bigger bandBand doesn't roll, at least not as badly as the other style3484:TighterNo padding in cups, just two layers of fabric, so less support, tooBand rolls badly, makes lumps under clothesBand tighter
Super soft leather, not bulky at all, husband loved it to replace his beat up one. The price you can't beat, when same wallet is $30 in the big retailer. Thanks!
My wife and I were well pleased with the cost and the quality of the hat we purchased.  It was a gift we were proud to give.
These boots very comfortable but I won't know how much I like them ,until I see if they keep my feet warm.
This is the ONLY bra I have found that fits my figure and is able to hold me up in full comfort.  A lot of my breast is under my arm, and this strong, comfortable material puts it back where it belongs -- front and center.  It is as comfortable as a support bra.  I can never find my size at the department store, so buying my hard-to-find size on Amazon was so easy.  And I can order my size in white, black or beige.  Amazon is where I will buy this bra from here on out.
I got this item at a great discount, thought it was cool and cute enough that even if it turned out cheap my girlfriend and I would like it. I was wrong.Its not bad by any means, but there is a looseness to the transforming action I was not expecting. Once you take it off, it immediately starts shifting and sliding around... which I guess is the point, but I was expecting a more solid construction and less give.My BIG issue with the ring however is that the two tone color is achieved by painting/dyeing/treating the metal after it is already assembled. This caused the silver to also become discoloured, and gives the whole thing a very cheap look. its ugly when it slides apart since there are several large grey blotches on what is supposed to be a silver finish.Anyway, try your luck. I got it at a cheap price, and you get what you pay for.
Look great and are a great shoe for a fair price.  I will buy these again when a replacement is needed
These boots are just what I was looking for.  They are so easy to put on and get off. They are very comfortable
I really liked the costume...on-line.The cape has this velcro fastner that feels like it's choking you,I hated it .the boot covers were too short to cover the tip of you're regular shoe and they would fall down you're legs ,very uncomfortable....  so I bought go go boots to wear with it at the last minute.The belt around the waist was too small. The velcro  was not sticking so the belt kept falling off.horrible time wearing it.=[
I have these pants in beige as well.  I like the design and the fabric is a nice quality.  But at 5' 3&#34; and about 100 lbs, the size 4P pants do run a little short.  They can only be worn with flats or boots.  Otherwise a good buy.
I ordered the set with size 3T and get the pants 2T, 2T polo and jacket size 5, so that my son can not use anything as or very small or extremely large.When ordered I was in MIami, but the order came a day before I go back to my country, so it was impossible to return it.
This product was as good as it looks, I loved it! I bought it as a gift to my boyfriend, he has almost the same one but it has around 6 years and needed a change! By today he hasn't received it! But im sure he'll like it! Very good quality material, although I was looking for the color that he has wich is a very dark brown that it kind of looks like black but its not? However black is fine!!
Its a nice hat, very cool that it is reversible and the graphic looks nice.  But if you have a small head it tends to sit up a little too high in my opinion
These are excellent boots. However, they do need to be purchased in a size larger than one's shoe size since they go over shoes.
Soild well built watch, looks and feel way more expensive than what it cost. The cyclops now really magnifies the date, something the older Invicta models just didn't do well...at all. Also the watch has a quick connect system which makes it easy to remove and change out the band.
I bought this wallet a 1 1/2 years ago, the zipper broke, so I returned it and they gave me a new one (which was a different model). They said they didn't have the old one anymore. The one I have now is bulky, stiff, and it hurts to sit on. In addition the zipper just broke.  I can return it and get a new one, but I don't want this wallet again.
The only way I can fully describe my admiration for this shoe is with a story.  My dad and I go on an annual backpacking trip near his house in Montana.  We're pretty serious backpackers - sometimes doing over 30 miles in two days.  This past summer I got all my stuff together and flew to Montana to go on the trip but realized the day before that I had forgot my trusty boots.  I had no choice but to buy new shoes and backpack with them  without breaking them in (breaking cardinal rule # 1 for backpackers).  We went with the intent to "take it easy" and planned out a route of 20 miles in three days, but after the first 8 miles my feet were so happy that we extended the trip.  It was some of the best packing I've ever done. And not only did I not get any blisters, but I didn't get to the campsite with a fanatical desire to take off my shoes.  Since then, I purchased an extra pair of these Keen boots because they make my feet just that happy. :)Some very cool features are: easy to waterproof - mine never leak, the little eyelits at the top keep your laces snug while you tie, feel more like sneakers than boots, adequate ankle support, VERY light (VERY important after twenty miles of hiking!) and good tread.  Cheers!
This shoe is fun to wear.  I love the purple color.  The shoe is good quality.
I have a couple of pairs of these great flip-flops with an arch in them.  I ordered my typical size 10 and they are just a little bit too small and have to go back.  The ribbon strap is great and the "mushy" sole feels wonderful.  Once you try these you will never go back to your cheesy flips.There are no half sizes so I guess these shoes are running smaller than they used to.  Order up a half size if possible.
These are a great woman's panty for comfortable every day wear. The fit is good and they wash well without shrinking.
This is the kind of wallet I have been looking for, so many features/function, credit card slots and pouches to put my business cards and receipts in.  Plus the look is so ----dang cool, and genuine leather.  It is the kind of wallet that gets better and better with age!
Bought this watch for my son because he learned to tell time.  He likes it and it's comfortable for him to wear.  Wanted a water-resistant watch with an indiglo night light so he could play in water and wear it at night.  Nice product for a good price.
I looked everywhere for a women's water shoe that had a larger toe box to accommodate a painful toe, and this one really fit the bill! Plus, it's stable soaking wet on the surfaces outside of the pool, too! It's not bad that it looks cool, either!
It's just as the picture shows.  Sort of a stylish sweat coat, very nice.  It's a Christmas present for my daughter and I'm very satisfied.
I bought this for my daughter Alexis.  It changes colors in different lighting.  I was hoping it would be blue but her version seemed more on the purple side while indoors.  It is a beautiful necklace.  Not all Alexandrite stones look the same.  Some may be blue most of the time and some may not.  My daughter is very proud of the necklace.
This is a beautiful set. Perfect for work as the are not to flashy. I bought this set for the necklace and am really happy with the look of the earrings as well.
Adorable my daughter loves It it may not be child size be it fits children no problem more room to tuck all their hair into
I have purchased items made by Columbia before and they make top quality products that are made to last. This was a very good deal for the price.
I was looking for a watch with a vibration-alarm to wake me up without waking up my wife. In the shops in Brussels, Belgium,Europe I couldn't find it, neither on internet.  Finally I found iton Amazon.com.  It's a good formed and very practical watch that wakes me up most of the times. Not when I'm in the deepest fase of my sleep. Then comes my GSM-alarm in action after 16 minutes,because mij Casio-Watch is repeating the vibration 3 or 4 times every 5 minutes. It has a good illumination that can switch on automatically when you move your wrist to look. Practical.I'm satisfied about this G-Shock, also about the quick delivery and payment.  Ren&eacute;.
Glad it only cost $40.00, its worth half that like it says Walmart kinda sad, not worth it at all
So mad at myself for buying these, the return date past for these shoes so I'm stuck selling them on ebay :( First of all they don't run true to size I got a 7 and it's pretty tight around my ankle. Its really cheap looking material and very dangerous to walk in. I would not for the life of me recommend these shoes to anyone they're absolutely atrocious.
I ordered this necklace and loved it, but I only wore it 5 times and it broke... You get what you pay for I guess...
Absolutely beautiful watch. Much nicer than picture. It's for my dad so hopefully he likes it. Got it for a great price & wonderful service & delivery from Amazon. Well done. Another great purchase I made.
I bought this gift as a last-minute desperate replacement for my mother-in-law for Christmas. It arrived very quickly, and it is very dainty and just lovely. I was a bit worried about the clasp, but it has the swinging mechanism plus another clip that requires you to sort of push a button to slide the clasp out. It's not so tiny that I'm worried about it breaking, and not so large that it looks fake. I'll post photos when I figure out how.Definitely amazing, and I am yet again very pleased with the quality from Silver Speck. The only thing I debated docking a star for was that their jewelry is packaged in a somewhat cheap, light blue bag with &#34;Silver Speck&#34; embossed in silver on it--not in a box or nice pouch as I've had from other sellers. Since the jewelry seems to be pretty good quality, the packaging actually makes it look cheaper. But overall, I have old jewelry boxes I can use, and you can always buy them with the money you save when you order from this seller!!
I got this coat on sale for about $200. Then I went to the department store and tried on other known makers of nice overcoats, on sale for half this price.  I actually bought one and brought it home.  When I tried on this Amazon one, then the dept store one, I quickly packed up the dept store one and took it back for a refund. The Kenneth Cole Kennedy coat hangs and looks that much better. Plain design, soft fabric, nice full length warm liner that I'll take out this summer.  Looking forward to the next rainy day!
These are great jeans !  Snug fit with stretch. Higher rise waistband so no muffin top. I had them shortened so I can wear with flats. Love em!
If you have a low budget, these shoes are awesome, fit as expected and are confortable. I Train with this shoes and is a good option. I think is a very good purchase!
This shirt looks great and fits really well on my husband. We are both big game of thrones fans, and he prefers house stark so this is perfect for him without looking too nerdy or anything.
I really like this handbag, it's roomy, I can carry all my things inside of it!! Good quality. I have received so many compliments.
These were just what I wanted.  Very attractive in an understated way.  Not over the top, not too large, but classy enough to be appreciated and they were well loved!
My ankle/foot doctor sells this brand in his office and I loved the sandals and flip flops and thought why not order this for an easy shoe to wear. Easy and comfy but orthodic built into the shoe has an arch that is placed weird compared to the other shoes of this brand and it irritates my condition so much that I was in agony just wearing for a few errands. Brought it with me to have dr take a look and he told me all that I mentioned above if only I could take the orthodic out and put my own in I would love this shoe. Wish it worked for me ;( cause it was cute and ideal.
I ordered this on a Wednesday, it arrived (free shipping) on Thursday.  I couldn't be more pleased.  It is exactly as advertised.  The fit is perfect, the leather is high-quality, and it looks really good.  It arrived carefully packed, wrinkle-free, and smelling just like a leather coat should.  I highly recommend this coat, and would not hessitate to order from this company again.
Rough Cut is an understatement.  The ring is absolutely gorgeous but there are so many scratches across the face of the ruby that it absolutely ruins it.  There is no shine at all, as depicted in the photo, just graying hairline scratches.  I would have returned the ring but missed the window of opportunity to do so.  It's unfortunate there are so many scratches on it because otherwise it would be stunning.
I bought this to keep my jewelry organized. It lived up to my highest expectations. The "leather" kind of feels fake to me, but it isn't noticeable unless you really look at it and feel it. It is actually leather, but it feels more like vinyl. Aside from that, I love the design and the color. It is a little lighter in color than the posted picture. Another reviewer mentioned this. The box is well designed and stays closed tight. It is sturdy. I've posted some pictures of the box above.I would definitely repurchase. Great value.
I ordered this watch for a graduation gift for my daughter. It arrived a couple days before I expected it to. She got to wear it for the actual graduation. It was for her masters degree and I caught her playing with during the ceremony. She loves it. Great watch.
This is my first slim wallet and I intend to stay with this brand forever. The wallet is very lightweight, slim, and can fit my most important items without bulking up... After about 4-5 months it is still in great condition and the material is holding up nicely.....
I received the gloves within the time specified.  They fit snuggly but the lining in one finger seems to be loose and caused  some difficulty  putting the glove on.  I have purchased this brand before and was surprised at the way the lining was not properly set in the glove.  I suppose that is whay they were discounted.  Once on, there seems to be no other problems.
I received my leg warmers before the estimated delivery date...  I am satisfied with my order and the service that I received... I will recommend this vendor and I will be ordering again from them in the future...
Just Buy It...Seriously.Life is Uncertain, and You never know when you will need a chicken hat!Avoid disappointment and Future Regret - Buy Now!
I've been sold on Duofold for 30 years and they have yet to let me down. I had 2 pair of one piece that i rotated and kept on for 3 months during the ski season.
I work out in the sun ALL DAY LONG, all year round. Before I got the sunsleeves, it always felt like my skin was cooking under the sun or getting windburned at times. Look, if you didn't heed your mothers warnings about sun damage when you were younger, protect your skin now. The sunsleeves are moisture wicking, so even in the hot sun, you don't even know they're there. Just peace of mind that your skin is protected from the suns damaging rays. Buh-bye greasy sunblock!
I like to think that i am a pretty good opinion on sandals as i live in the desert and wear them almost daily. So far these are the most comfortable flip flop i have owned. The fit is quite snug so your foot feels very secure int hem and don't have to worry about losing one if you had to jog across a crosswalk or anything like that. The other part that got me were that these are very comfortable, they almost feel squishy and manage that without being obtrusively thick.  I will actually end up ordering the black pair more than likely as a back up. Spend the extra $5 compared to a standard thing flip fop and pick a pair of these up. One last note would be if you have a little wider foot than a normal D width, these will be a very snug fit.
I was pleased in the product. It arrived quickly and I have enjoyed the pants.  Being a large man, I really appreciate a product that is tough and comfortable.  Thank you.
I use these sunglasses everyday at my summer counselor job.  Even with roughness of 55 children these have 0 scratches on the frames or lense... if you want some Oakley's these are well worth it..
Excellent customer service and wonderful jacket! I ordered a medium size and grossly underestimated what size I'd need since the listed sizes differ (I think) from US sizes.  I'm 6'3&#34; and slim and size M would fit a child. I ended up returning it and having it replaced with a XL and it fits me very nicely.The customer service I received was wonderful, they were very understanding of the size mishap and I had a new one sent to me as soon as it could be.Some things to note:Depending on your location shipping time could take a few weeks.Sleeves by wrists could be tighter, but if you push up your sleeves like in the product picture you'll be fine.Material is very warm but doesn't stand up too well against very cold wind!Overall, I would recommend this jacket!
Very comfortable scrub bottoms. Fold over waist keeps you from having to deal with the elastic that can bite into your skin.Easy to bend down in. It would be nice if they had more pockets. There is only one pocket on the leg. Size runs bigger than what you would normally wear. They do look slimming like the way they advertise.
Great find!  Light weight, and oh, so comfy!  Fast fast fast shipping too!  I love these boots! I got the boots in black, as a birthday present.  I will be purchasing them in another color as well. Do not hesitate on these little gems!
I bought this vest for my 3 1/2 year old for his construction worker Halloween costume.  It's working out perfectly!  He loves it.  It's big so I know he'll be able to play with it for a while but doesn't look bad that it's too big.  Can't go wrong especially for the price.  Definitely recommend it.
Woman's boot size 11wide.....check! Tall boots for an 18inch calf.....check!  Rich, dark brown color.....check!  Leather.....check!  Dare I dream for boots that are waterproof.....check!  Reasonably priced.....check!  Awesome fit.....check!  Comfortable.....check! Perfect heel height.....check! Whew, I'm all checked out.For me to find all of this in one boot and at this price was unimaginable.I've only had the boots for a few days and they seem to slouch a little on my legs but I am still extremely satisfied with this purchase.Kudos for the fast service too!
The most gorgeous, true to size.. Pliner. Since Pliner runs narrow, I had to stretch them a bit.. but this was easy since the leather is super-soft.Am excited to own a shoe like this for such a reasonable price.. thank you so much, Amazon !
I BOUGHT THE AS RELAXED FIT, BUT THE DON'T FIT LIKE OTHER DOCKER RELAXED FIT PANTS THAT I HAVE BOUGHT IN THE PAST
I have been searching for a long winter robe for about 3 years and there was always something that I wasn't happy with, mostly all were too short and I wanted one to my ankles.  This robe is just the right length, and exceptional warm.  We RV full time and enjoy winter weather, presently in CO, RV's aren't always the warmest so the down robe couldn't be better.  I don't find that there are scratchy feathers poking through as described in some other reviews, the robe is very cozy.  One thing, I ordered the peach thinking it would be a darker color and it is an exceptional light peach.  I would recommend this robe.
I wanted some black fancy boots! I have been looking for a while, and came upon these bu accident. They are so much cheaper than any of the others i have been looking at. They are a bit shorter than i was wanting but for the price I had to get them, and i am not disappointed they are beautiful! And i just love Justins they are so comfy from the first time you put them on, no weeks of hurting feet trying to break them in!!
I just received this beautiful watch as a late birthday gift, and I couldn't be more pleased with it.  When I first took it out, I was immediately impressed with the beauty of the watch as whole.  It is very intricate, from the elegant hands to the wonderful features of the different complications.  The opening that allows a view into the inner workings is captivating, as is an incredible eye-catcher.  For the price paid, which is much better than any actual watch store, it is really an incredible buy, rivaling much more expensive watches in design and beauty.  My only issues are that the clasp is not my favorite type, featuring a duel lock instead of the more typical clasp, and that there is no form of micro adjusting, though this can be overcome because the removable links are of two different sizes.  I have not been wearing it enough to comment on the accuracy, though I am sure, being an automatic, that it is not perfect.  Overall, the watch is wonderful, a great timepiece for daily wear if you have the budget, but more likely just to impress others at formal events, where you are sure to get many compliments.
I've had these boots for about a day now and I can already tell they are awesome.  I've exclusively worn boots for the past thirty years and I can already tell that these are up there with the best.  Most have commented on the fact that there will be a long break in period, but I don't see that.  I highly recommend these boots, comfortable, awesome looking and very well made.  Size is right on.
Just received mine and it is gorgeous!  (It's more gold & black than pink, I don't think the gold showed up in the photo as much as the pink did.)  It also has silver sequins mixed in with the gold and pink ones.  Everyone in my class gave a compliment and it sounded great.  It's fun to shimmy in!  Looks much more expensive than $19.99.  The s&h is high, but fair if you order more than one item from Bellyqueen/Opentip.  So shop away!
Ridiculously cheap material and cheaply made.  The company took the time to wrap it like a gift and even add a lolly pop to the wrapping. That was a nice thought but I'd rather they put that effort into sending me the correct size AND making the shirt out of a quality material. It's junk! For this price I expected something nice. This shirt honestly looks like something you'd receive out of a cheap costume kit, you know the kind sold at discount stores around Halloween.  Don't waste your money like I did.I'll be returning this cheap costume shirt.
Purchased a size 6 last year for my then 1.5 year old and we just purchased a size 8 this year for our 2.5 year old. Fits as expected. Sturdy. Good for in and out of water. Excellent shoe. Thicker sole than other Salt Water shoes.
We bought this for Halloween for our little boy. It held up well for a long day of Halloween festivities. He wears 12 month clothes and it fit him fine over long pants and a sweatshirt. The hat was small, though.
I never have to iron these scrub pants because the fabric doesn't hold a wrinkle very well.  The cargo pocket is perfect for my iPhone, even in its bulky otterbox case.  I first bought a purple pair of these and loved them so much I had to buy the black so I could wear them more often.  These are my favorite scrub pants.
I almost didn't get these because when I read the previous review and the others on endless i got a little scared and was like there's no way i am going to feel like messing around with some shoe just to be cute.I saw a video on 6pm .com (zappos has the same video) on how to "work" this shoe and decided to take a chance and buy them.The shoes are true to size no arch support and are very different as far as fastening them goes.I like them and I am glad i took a chance... I plan to wear them with a Maxi dress.
The color of the belt was not what was shown in the image online but it was a color I was okay with so no big issue. I actually prefer the color I got but this is definitely something to watch out for. The size was right (I order 1 size above pant waist size as suggested). Didn't have a smell as others reported.The biggest issue are the snaps. They are very weak, I can flip the belt open with one light tap. I'll probably just replace them myself (since I know someone that has the tool for the snaps) as opposed to the hassle of a return and taking a chance that the replacement doesn't have the same issue.  The snap issue is mentioned by others as well so it appears to be a crap shoot of whether you will get one with proper snaps or not.
This product is outstanding, very good quality, the graphics of the Bat is excellent. big kudos to the designer. Nice weight to it also...
This wig was great for my Halloween costume!  I was a bee hive to match my daughter's bee costume and my husband's bee keeper costume.  It does not look realistic so I wouldn't buy as a real wig.
The Copper insoles feel great in my shoes when I work out. I have low arches and these are much better than the custom orthotics I was using. Took no time at all to get used to them. I ordered the size 7.5 - 9 because I wear a size 9 shoe. I will order the next size up and trim them as these do not go all the way to the toe of my shoe. Wish the sizing was 9 - 9.5.
I have a pair of Natural color Bobs Doily I bought two years ago and I love them! But, as with any Bobs or Toms shoes I learned that you have to buy 1/2 size smaller. I wear an 8.5 so I had return and get a size 8.
I love these sneakers, I have several different pairs of them, I wear one or the other pair every day! No, need to break them in they come ready and comfortable to wear!
Looks like it is made out of paper....would not buy it again!  Spend the $10 toward something of better quality! :)  Would only be good for a costume...nothing else!
This it's a good costume very sexy and comfort its great the materials are promising becose the materials looks like chip ones but fits and look very well
Hubby loves it got it for his birthday, fits well looks great! Good price, I would  recommend it for a BB Heisenberg fan for sure.
its a bit shiny and looks metallic grey, the watch is awesome and its very likable, very great deal awesome
I'm a nurse and like most places in health care we are no longer permitted to wear the classic croc slip on due to holes in the top and lacking a closed back. This shoes are perfect, yes they do have some perforations on the side but it's a non issue. A little snug the first day wearing and I'd recommend wearing casually before wearing to actually work in if that's your plan. And get the green, draws lots of attention . lol. All in all, comfortable shoes, be sure to break them in first, by a size larger if you can (I have a more narrow foot and still fit fine on sides with larger size), hope this helps some people choose of on the edge of a decision.
I like ASICS- great shoe for the price. I normally wear a 9, ordered a 9.5 bc I always get workout shoes 1/2 size bigger, but my toe came right to the edge! No room for inserts.
It looks good on line and is seriously for someone who want to look good, but does not want to spend the money.  I bought it for a friend who says that he likes to wear watches but he always scatches the face and ruins them.  Who cares if he ruins this one?  It is cheap enough to get another!
I got this sooner that what the confirmation said. I love them they are original and classy. Love them and will continue buying more Tiffany sun glasses.
I have this watch in sort of a mid-green color, and I've beat it to death.  Runs like a top, does everything I need.  Plus, I'm a scuba diver and have had it at depths of up to 110 feet fairly often without problems.  It really IS water resistant.True, the watchband dies pretty quickly, but I found several places to buy a replacement for an average price of $12...one is a sports outlet with three initials in the name - the 18th letter of the alphabet, the 5th, and the ninth.  I've had mine for over a year and the battery's still going, but admittedly you probably do have to take it to a jeweler to have it replaced.Good luck!
This thing is really awful wear.  It sheds fur constantly, if you have any stubble at all it will get all over your face and tickle like crazy.  You can't see out if it, and you look out the mouth.  I put it on for pictures and then took it right back off.
These are so close to the real thing. It can fool some of the best. These are heavy and look as if they will keep satisfying me.
I am a young and active woman, but sometimes I find that I get more attention from men than I would like. I tried getting a bad perm, not wearing makeup and gaining weight, but men are determined, and I kept getting hit on.Finally, I found the answer: TEVAS. I slipped on a pair of these and sure enough, men were running from me like Japanese people running from Godzilla. I can't get a date to save my life and I am loving all this free time. Thanks to Tevas, I am 100% man-repellant, and I can finally get some work done.
they fit, the problem is getting them off to launder them without getting them in a knot so they almost seem like a one time only product
Loved the color. Definitely works for high impact activities like running. Seems to run small though. I would go up a size when ordering.
I just received the Silverlake purse in Teak Multi as a gift.  It is beautiful!  I have a hard time finding the right size purse for my needs.  This is exactly the size I like.  It holds all of my necessities with a little room to spare.  The drop length of the shoulder strap is perfect, and sits comfortably on my shoulder, with the purse tucked nicely under my arm.  I also love the detachable cross-body strap.  The color of the leather is gorgeous; a rich brown with touches of warm brownish/pink, dark brown and copper on the flap.  I have no complaints.  I plan to use it daily.  If any issues arise, I will update my review.  In the meantime, I love it!
Super cute moccasins, exactly as I wanted them.BUT I normally wear size 8 to 8 and a half!I bought size 8, thinking the moccasins would stretch out. They don't. Super tight. Size Up!!!SIze 9 fits for me.
I was absolutely thrilled when I laid eyes on this wallet. The product is exactly as shown. I was afraid the colors would be lighter, but they match perfectly with the picture. It's also roomier than I expected, but just the right size for bills, checks, cards and a spacious area to keep my change in the back, and hold everything securely in it's place. The fabric is beautiful and looks as if it can hold up to some abuse. The snap on the front is magnetized, so there's no need to worry about your objects falling out. Overall I've never had a better wallet. I would highly recommend this.
This is my second pair of Merrell shoes. These are almost exactly like my first pair. I love the way they look but these are small for the supposed size and I have to wear very thin socks. This will be okay for summer, but not so good for the winter. Hopefully they will stretch some before then.
I didn't give this review five stars, because it is a little difficult to put on. This may be due to my lack of experience in wearing a corset, but with the design of this one it might take figuring out a trick. There are 5 metal hooks in front and boning that runs vertically them, and it's a little difficult to get them all hooked at the same time. Also, I followed the sizing chart provided by the seller, and it's not the most accurate. I am a size 12 and fall within the parameters given, but should have gone up a size. Maybe it would be a little easier to put on if I had. I am keeping the item as I do like it, but if you're considering ordering this I would go up a size than what is indicated.
This Panache camisole with built in bra is amazing! Being a middle aged woman with large breasts, I thought my days of wearing a cute and cool cami in the summer were long gone. Since I sag to my knees (or so it seems to me!) without a bra, and my size (36DD)makes the typical "shelf bras" found in cami's worthless, I typically don't wear anything sleeveless unless the straps are substantial enough to hide my ever-present bra straps. I found this camisole originally on a flash sale site and bought one on a chance. Boy am I glad I did! The built in bra is structured with molded cups, underwires for support, a band that fastens with hook and eyes in the back just like a real bra, and adjustable spaghetti straps. Since I was concerned about too much clinginess around my tummy, I bought a 38E ( same as a 38DD in american sizes). The fit is just right! The bra doesn't dig in around the band, the support offered by the bra is firm enough that I don't droop and in fact it imparts a nice shape. The cami fabric drapes down nicely, just skimming my natural shape. I love this cami and came to amazon today to look for additional colors to purchase.I think size selection is very important with this product and I encourage all potential purchasers to get out a measuring tape and measure themselves before selecting a size. The fit of the band is very important with this garment. All of the support comes from that band as the spaghetti straps are not meant to contribute to the bras actual support in any significant manner. Personally I upsized the band from my usual 36 to a 38 as I wanted to be sure the tummy portion of the cami didn't cling. I am happy I did that and I feel like I have gotten a great fit from the size I chose.This cami is going to be a wardrobe staple for me for years to come I believe!
This necklace has such a nice price tag, it's hard to resist. I don't know much about pearls, except that now that I have some, I am hooked. After buying these I was very happy with them and decided to buy pearl earrings and a pearl bracelet. So I did some research and I kinda wished I had waited. When my earrings arrived, the quality difference was immediately noticeable. After looking at some of the markers of the quality of pearls (some of which I still don't fully understand like the nacre) I noticed that these pearls are slightly misshapen and have blemishes on them. However, I am still pleased with them overall as I can't really tell the difference unless I actually inspect and compare them to high quality pearls... and no one else has questioned their quality either!I am happy to wear them often because I know what I actually paid and I am not worried my son or the toddlers I nanny may ruin them. Wearing them often enhances whatever I am wearing and I can use them in many situations. For my wedding I will get something nicer, though, and I personally wouldn't get them as a gift for a really special occasion. This would do better as a small token of appreciation or jewelry you don't have to worry about damaging when wearing often.
I passed several the same bibs up because they only came in 3xl and final came across this pair in my size. Huge pair of bib overalls came in mail with xxxl stamped all over it and I could  actually fit 3 people inside.
This dress is beautiful. I bought it for a trip to St. Augustine, Fl. The seller is excellent and it was delivered quickly. I am very happy with the seller and the product.
This top is very sexy and you will receive many compliments when you wear it.  It runs true to size but is not quite as long as other Patty tops I have ordered but I absolutely love it and so does my husband.  I ordered it in red an black as well.
HE RECIBIDO LOS LENTES Y SON FABULOSOS. ME ENCANTAN.!! SON DE EXCELENTE CALIDAD. A MI ESPOSO LE FASCINO EL REGALO. LO RECOMIENDO 100%. DESDE VENEZUELA.
So far this garment bag seems to be durable and is exactly what I expected.  My husband drops it off at the dry cleaners with his shirts and they fit about 10 clean shirts inside.  I felt guilty about the plastic bags they normally use even though they supposedly recycle them.
